## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+), npm or yarn  
- A supported wallet browser extension or mobile app (MetaMask / WalletConnect / OKX)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nft-dashboard-pi.git
cd nft-dashboard-pi
npm install
Configuration
Create a .env.local file in the root directory:

ini
Copy
Edit
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=your_rpc_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=your_chain_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
Running Locally
bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Visit http://localhost:3000 to load the dashboard.

🧪 Usage
Click Connect Wallet → choose preferred wallet/provider.

Grant wallet access to your dashboard.

Once connected, NFTs display in the “My NFTs” section.

Explore stats, filter or search tokens, and optionally transfer or list assets.

🧩 Architecture Overview
WalletConnector.tsx — handles user authentication via Web3 providers

NFTGrid — dynamically fetches and lays out NFTs with metadata from APIs

AnalyticsPanel — visual KPI dashboard: sale count, volume, floor price trends

AtomicMutation — functions for actions like sending or listing a token

🧠 Best Practices
Responsive NFT dashboards often follow design principles that enable quick insight and low friction for user actions:

Prioritize key metrics like floor price and trading volume

Visual widgets simplify scanning collection performance

Clear wallet integration workflow and feedback loops for success/errors

Balance data freshness with efficiency—cache smartly while auto-updating

⚙️ Deployment (Vercel)
Push your code to GitHub or another Git provider.

Setup a Vercel project and link your repository.

In Vercel dashboard, choose the correct framework (e.g. Next.js).

Add environment variables via Vercel’s Settings → Environment Variables.

Vercel auto‑builds and deploys on every push to main (or your chosen branch).

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
Wallet not connecting	Ensure the wallet network matches NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID
Metadata won’t load	Verify API rate‑limits and correct endpoint or key
Deployment fails	Confirm Vercel build preset is correct, clear build cache
